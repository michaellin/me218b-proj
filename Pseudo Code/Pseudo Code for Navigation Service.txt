Pseudo Code for Navigation Service

Navigation State Machine:

RunNavigationSM
Takes event as parameter; Returns an event

Define the make transition variable as false
Set next navigation state to current navigation state
Set entry event kind to normal entry to new state
Set return event to current event (assume we are not consuming event)

Switch between current state
	Case: current state is POSITIONING
		Execute during function for this state
		If an event is active
			Switch between the event type of the current event
				Case: ES_NewPosition 
					Set next state to DRIVING
					Set make transition variable as true
					Option to consume event (decide later)
				Break Case
			End switch
		End if
	Break case
	Case: current state is DRIVING
		Execute during function for this state
		If an event is active
			Switch between the event type of the current event
				Case: ES_Reached_City
					Set next state to POSITIONING
					Set make transition variable as true
					Option to consume event (decide later)
				Break Case
			End switch
		End if 
	Break case
End Switch

If we are making a state transition
	Execute exit function for current state
	Set current state to next state
	Execute entry function for new state
End if
Return ReturnEvent


StartNavigationSM
Takes event parameter of current event. Returns nothing. Does any required initialization for this state machine.

Set volatile local variable to get debugger to display the value of CurrentEvent.
Set current state to POSITIONING (Entry State) – (assumes no history)
Call the entry function for the Entry_State

DuringPositioningState
Private function. During function for positioning state.

Assume no re-mapping of consumption of event
If event is ES_Entry or ES_Entry_History
	Implement any entry actions
	Start the positioning state machine 
Else if event is ES_Exit
	Pass the exit event to positioning state machine
	If we’re off road
Run full triangulation algorithm for coordinates and orientation
	Else if we’re at a city
		Run partial triangulation algorithm for orientation only
	End if
Do other local exit functionality (return stepper to reference)
Else
	Run positioning state machine
End if
Return NewEvent

DuringDrivingState
Private function. During function for positioning state.

Assume no re-mapping of consumption of event
If event is ES_Entry or ES_Entry_History
	Implement any entry actions
	Start the driving state machine 
Else if event is ES_Exit
	Pass the exit event to driving state machine
	Do local exit functionality (stop motors)
Else
	Run driving state machine
End if
Return NewEvent



Positioning State Machine:

RunPositioningSM
Takes event as parameter; Returns an event

Define the make transition variable as false
Set next positioning state to current positioning state
Set entry event kind to normal entry to new state
Set return event to current event (assume we are not consuming event)

Switch between current state
	Case: current state is CALIBRATING
		Execute during function for this state
		If an event is active
			Switch between the event type of the current event
				Case: Step_Timer_Timeout
					Set make transition variable as true
					Option to consume event (decide later)
				Break Case
				Case: Step_Calibration_Done
					Set next state to SCANNING
					Set make transition variable as true
					Option to consume event (decide later)
				Break Case
			End switch
		End if
	Break case
	Case: current state is SCANNING
		Execute during function for this state
		If an event is active
			Switch between the event type of the current event
				Case: Step_Timer_Timeout
					Set make transition variable as true
					Option to consume event (decide later)
				Break Case
			End switch
		End if 
	Break case
End Switch

If we are making a state transition
	Execute exit function for current state
	Set current state to next state
	Execute entry function for new state
End if
Return ReturnEvent
StartPositioningSM
Takes event parameter of current event. Returns nothing. Does any required initialization for this state machine.

If the current event type is not equal to ES_ENTRY_HISTORY
	Set current state to calibrating
End if
Call the Run positioning SM with the current event parameter

DuringCalibratingState
Private function. During function for positioning state.

Assume no re-mapping of consumption of event
If event is ES_Entry or ES_Entry_History
	Implement any entry actions: Read Magnet Sensor, Start step timer
Else if event is ES_Exit
	Do local exit functionality 
Else
	Do nothing
End if
Return NewEvent

DuringScanningState
Private function. During function for positioning state.

Assume no re-mapping of consumption of event
If event is ES_Entry or ES_Entry_History
	Implement any entry actions: Read IR Sensor, Start step timer
Else if event is ES_Exit
	Do local exit functionality
Else
	Do nothing
End if
Return NewEvent
